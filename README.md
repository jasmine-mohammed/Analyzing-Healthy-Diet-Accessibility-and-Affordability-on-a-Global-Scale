# Analyzing Healthy Diet Accessibility & Affordability on a Global Scale

## Project Summary
Using publicly available diet and census data, we analyzed the cost and affordability of a healthy diet across the world and the relationship between this affordability and population estimators (e.g. migration and fertility rates, life expectancy). This project was completed as a final project for my Data Science Concepts and Analysis course at UCSB in 03/23. 

## My Contribution 
This was a group project in which I contributed to the data preparation, background, aims, datasets, methods, and discussion sections, made the tables and scatterplots, contributed to the variable summaries and regression analysis, and did the formatting.

## Aims 
We aimed to identify which countries have experienced the highest and lowest levels of food insecurity and if the cost of a healthy diet may contribute to food insecurity. We also sought to identify whether or not food insecurity may play a factor in a country's net migration, fertility rates, and life expectancy.

## Data Set
Two data sets were used. The data sets are publicly available at the [World Bank Group's Food Prices for Nutrition DataHub](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/food-prices-for-nutrition) and the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/table?COUNTRY_YEAR=2017&COUNTRY_YR_ANIM=2017&menu=tableViz&quickReports=CUSTOM&CUSTOM_COLS=AREA_KM2,POP,MPOP,FPOP,GR,RNI,POP_DENS,TFR,CBR,E0_M,E0_F,CDR,NMR&TABLE_YEARS=2017&TABLE_USE_RANGE=N&TABLE_USE_YEARS=Y&TABLE_STEP=1&TABLE_ADD_YEARS=2017).
